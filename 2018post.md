So this wasn't actually that popular last year and I wasn't actually going to bring it back, but due to popular demand (aka 1 entire person) I've decided to make it again.

This is in the same format as last year, generic football field and all. Please tell me if I screwed up anywhere!

As before, I got the schedule data from Massey Ratings. I also uploaded my process to [GitHub](https://github.com/infinitempg/CFB-Schedules) because honestly I forgot how I did it last year and had to work backwards to figure it out.
